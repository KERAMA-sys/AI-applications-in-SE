‚úÖ Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
This section includes:

Short answer questions about AI code generation, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and bias in personalization.

A case study analysis on the impact of AIOps in software deployment pipelines.

See: Part1_Theoretical_Analysis.md

üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Practical Implementation
Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
Tool: GitHub Copilot

Task: Implement and compare code generated by AI and written manually for sorting a list of dictionaries by a key.

Includes a 200-word comparative analysis.

File: task1_code_completion.py
Analysis: task1_analysis.md

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
Tool: Testim.io or Selenium IDE with AI Plugins

Task: Automate test cases for a login form with both valid and invalid credentials.

Output: Screenshot of results and 150-word summary.

Files:

login_test_script.testim or selenium_test.py

Screenshot: results_screenshot.png

Summary: task2_summary.md

Task 3: Predictive Analytics
Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset

Task: Train a Random Forest model to classify issue priority (high/medium/low).

Metrics: Accuracy and F1-score

Notebook: task3_predictive_model.ipynb

üß© Part 3: Ethical Reflection
A reflection on potential biases in the dataset used in Task 3 and how tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 can mitigate them.

See: ethics_reflection.md

üí° Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge
